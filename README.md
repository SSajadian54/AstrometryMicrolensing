# AstrometryMicrolensing

There are two C++  codes. These codes generate the astrometry microlensing events. These events are assumed to be detected 
with the Roman telescope. All astrometry microlensing curves are simulated during 5 years of the Roman mission.  

If you want to perform these codes on your own computer, you will need some more files that are read by the codes. 
In that case please contact me (sedighe.sajadian@gmail.com)

Two  *.txt files are the Roman photometry and astrometry precisions versus the apparent magnitude of the source star in W149 
which were kindly provided by J. Somsone, and S. Calchi Novati.
